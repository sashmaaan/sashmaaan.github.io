---

Born in 1988, grown up in Tuttlingen, Germany. I studied Software-Engineering at the great Lake Constance, worked for more than six years as a Software Developer / IT-Consultant, always loved to travel the world and experience new things and sports, and now working as a self employed software developer, always interested to hear about new ideas and projects.

### Facts
My skill set is based on my last employments, that means i am most experienced in 
 - writing VB.Net applications with DevExpress user interfaces 
 - all the camos products (camos Configurator, camos Quotation, camos Develop, ...)
 - Microsoft SQL Server

Other technologies i already used before:
JavaScript, NodeJS, jQuery, HTML, CSS, XML/XPath, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, C++, Qt Framework, Java, Access VBA

Since i am traveling and working mostly remote, i am of course willing to learn new technologies, languages and frameworks, whatever the project needs.
